## What does this app do?

This app is a front-end development project built upon a seperate back-end project I created. This app is a simple website that shows a list of reviews for different board games.

To use the app simply head to this link: https://darthshanreviewzone.netlify.app/user, and you can explore some of the functionality I've programmed into the app. With the app you can sort the review list by any of the properties listed as well as filter the reviews by category. You can then read each review in more detail by clicking on the title. When on a specific review you can like it, comment under it, or delete any previous comments. However, before commenting you must login to the example user on the profile page.

## Back-end Project

If you wish to look at the back-end project created for this app then please head to: https://github.com/DarthShan/NC-Games-Project

## Running the app locally

If you wish to the run the app locally then you'll first have to clone the repo and install all the dependencies.

```
npm i

Once you've done all that then you should be able to run:

```
npm start
```

in your terminal and it should open up a new browser window with your local app displayed.
